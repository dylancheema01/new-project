                <p>Established by veteran construction manager, Yoel Gruber in 2005, DICE
                     quickly earned its position in New York's construction sector for its "finger on the pulse" of the city's unique variables in general contracting and design/build services.
                    With a wide array of projects totaling millions of SF, DICE today is recognized a premiere provider of pre-construction and construction related services for the most discriminating clients.
                     Yoel's construction expertise as well as his dedication, focus and passion for his work make up the key components of the DICE corporate philosophy.
                      The passion for excellence he instilled into the comprehensive corporate structure continues to drive the company in its operations, goals, benchmarks, and expansion to an ever-growing, satisfied client base.
                    In addition to the critical aspects of value-added engineering, execution, efficiency and reliability, DICE clients benefit from our expertise in guiding owners and developers through the complex process of achieving and retaining compliance on their properties
                    Most of all, despite our growth, the underlying corporate trademarks of honesty, integrity, and mutual respect are what continue to define us.</p>
